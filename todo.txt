Analyze CIFAR
 - Look at 10-20 times the model was wrong
    - Pattern? 
    - Put it into some sort of report 


Start saving your plots
  - Make the title something that explains the current run 


Metrics: 

At the end of every epoch:
  - Average Training Loss
  - Average Validation Loss
  - Average Train Accuracy
  - Average Validation Accuracy


Can we make this work:

 - Our dataset is small 
 - Our model is simple
 - CIFAR is relatively simple
