Case 1:
    - Predicted: frog, Actual: cat
    - Ambiguous shape
    - Lack of distinguishing shadows
    - Distinguishing features: color pattern
    - Red and blue background

Case 2:
    - Predicted: car, Actual ship
    - Oversaturation of upper part, dark shadowing on bottom part
    - Lack of clearly defined lines
    - Red and black details
    - Bottom right corner shows water-like background

Case 3:
    - Predicted: dog, Acutal: car
    - Heavy shadows inside the car, around windows, and around tires
    - Car's white paint creates an unidentifiable shape once details are 
      obscured by heavy shadows
    - Red background above the shape

Case 4:
    - Predicted: deer, Actual: plane
    - No relative shadows to distinguish details
    - Clear shape and structure
    - Blue background

Case 5:
    - Predicted: deer, Actual: dog
    - Ambiguous shape
    - Lack of distinguishing shadows
    - Distinguishing features: color pattern, limbs
    - Red and black background

Case 6:
    - Aerial angle, uncommon profile
    - Shadows on deck of ship, saturation on front of ship
    - Green/black background, reminiscent of ocean
    - Waves and foaming around the ship in the water

Case 7:
    - Predicted: cat, Actual: dog
    - Clear dog head profile
    - Recognizable ears, eyes, and nose
    - Dark shadows in background

Case 8:
    - Predicted: cat, Actual: horse
    - Clear horse head profile
    - Recognizable nose, mouth, neck, bridle
    - Distinguishable horizon line, white ground, blue sky and background

Case 9:
    - Predicted: bird, Actual: deer
    - No distinguishing shapes
    - Black and blue picture, very dark
    - No defining details in color or background

Case 10:
    - Predicted: deer, Actual: dog
    - Very bright, saturated photo
    - Clear dog profile, terrier breed
    - Typical fur coloring
    - Noticeable ears, eyes, nose, tongue, letgs, and Typical

Cases 11-20:
    - Many photos were dark or had ambiguous shapes
    - Some lacked distinguishable details
    - Few, obvious mistakes made by the model

The model seems to be making predictions by looking for a clear 
figure in the photo and basing its predictions off of that. It 
struggles to identify figures when images are oversaturated or have 
heavy shadows that obscure details. Rarely, the model makes an obvious
error in identifying a figure. Often, the model struggles with unconventional
angles or objects. It does not seem to take the background and environment into 
consideration, as a human would do when classifying images.
